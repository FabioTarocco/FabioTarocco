### Hi there 👋
I am **Fabio Tarocco**
Ph.D. Student @[UNIVAQ :bird:](https://www.univaq.it/) under [DISIM :computer: :heavy_division_sign:](https://www.disim.univaq.it/)

Research topic: *Quantum Comuting* ⚛️, *Quantum Chemistry* 🧪, *Tensor Network Algorithms* 🌐, and  *Algorithms Design* ⚙️.

I am working in the [Quantum Computing and Computational Quantum Chemistry](https://dsfc.univaq.it/cbbc/) group, called **CBBC**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - *Single-reference Quantum Chemistry* methods for *Ground state systems*
  - *Variational Quantum Algorithms* for *Ground State resolution*
  - *TensorNetwork* methods: ***QC-DMRG***
  - *Multi-reference Quantum Chemistry* methods for *Excited systems*
  - *Variational algorithms* for *Excited State resolution*
  - *Quantum Information Theory*

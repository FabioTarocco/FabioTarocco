## About Me
I am **Fabio Tarocco**, born in 1998, from Verona, and now, living in $\frac{|\text{Verona}\rangle + |\text{L'Aquila}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Actually, Ph.D. student at the University of L'Aquila.

NO! I'm not the one in the profile picture, it's my *spirit guide*.

- 🎹 I am a music-devouring listener, I listen to whatever comes to mind, covering all possible genres. I have a particular inclination for electronic music, among all the subgenres Techno, Dark-Techno, and UK-Drum&Bass stand out.
My ✨ _secret dream_ ✨ is to go all night to the famous [Berghain](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berghain) club in Berlin 🖤
- 🎥 I love watching films, better at cinema. Sci-fi, Thriller, and Horror movies are my favorites.
- 🧑‍🍳 I love cooking as much as I love eating. You can convince me pretty quickly by proposing (*Kebab*,*Pizza*, *Hamburger*) $\leftarrow$ **Junk Food** in general, as well as a good *Risotto* or *Pasta*.

## About Me
I am **Fabio Tarocco**, born in 1998, from Verona, actually living in L'Aquila.

NO! I'm not the one in the profile picture, it's my *spirit guide*.

- 🎹 I am a music-devouring listener, I listen to whatever comes to mind, covering all possible genres. I have a particular inclination for electronic music, among all the subgenres Techno, Dark-Techno, Euro-Dance stand out.
My secret dream is to go all night at the famous [Berghain](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berghain) club in Berlin 🖤
